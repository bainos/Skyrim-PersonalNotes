# Skyrim Personal Notes - Development Guidelines

## [**MANDATORY**] Communication with Claude

- Keep chat responses super concise. No unnecessary explanations or preambles.
- Keep it simple. If something becomes complex throw a warning
- Do not guess. You are not supposed to know everything:
  1. Check existing source code
  2. Search the web for official documentation
  3. Acknowledge you do not know and ask for help
- **NEVER COMMIT** - User will explicitly tell when to commit
